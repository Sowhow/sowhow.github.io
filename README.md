## Anna Maria Eilertsen

I am a PhD student at the [University of Bergen](http://www.uib.no/en)'s [department of computer science](http://www.uib.no/en/ii), in the programming languages research group. My advisor is [Anya Bagge](https://www.ii.uib.no/~anya/).

Currently hanging out in Vancouver BC, at UBC, where I work under [Gail Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/gail-murphy)

I am interested in software language design and evolution, static analysis, program comprehention, refactoring and modelling. I am currently working on software language evolution and API/Client co-evolution.
