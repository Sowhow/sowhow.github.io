## Anna Maria Eilertsen

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Bergen](http://www.uib.no/en)'s [department of computer science](http://www.uib.no/en/ii), in the programming languages research group. My advisors are [Anya Bagge](https://www.ii.uib.no/~anya/) and [Gail Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/gail-murphy). 

I am passionate about making humans better at programming through education, tools, and language design. By designing tools and languages that abstract both lower-level instructions and developer's intuitive thinking-blocks, we fight against the inherent complexity of software. 

I am curious about how developers use and understand software languages and language-related tools. After doing my master's thesis on refactoring correctness, I became interested in bridging the gap between formal requirements and usability in refactoring tools. 

Currently, I am on a research stay with Dr. Gail Murphy at UBC, Vancouver BC. Under Murphy's supervision, I perform user studies of developers to learn how they use, underuse and misuse, refactoring tools. I also scrape repositories for 'real' refactorings and study how they compare to tool refactorings. 

I also have started and contributed to initiatives that increase diversity among computer science students. I am interested in challenges and solutions related to genders and inclusive culture in software engineering.
