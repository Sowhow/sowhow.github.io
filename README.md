## Anna Maria Eilertsen

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Bergen](http://www.uib.no/en)'s [department of computer science](http://www.uib.no/en/ii), in the programming languages research group. My advisors are [Anya Bagge](https://www.ii.uib.no/~anya/) and [Gail Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/gail-murphy). 

I am passionate about making humans better at programming through education, tools, and language design. By designing tools that let developers effectively instruct and understand machines, software can be created and changed faster and more accuratly. 

I also participate in initiatives for increased diversity in computer science and software engineering.
